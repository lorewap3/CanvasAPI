CanvasAPI
=========

Download data from the Canvas API into Google Spreadsheet.  

The Google Script will take the entered input (Canvas Token, Account Number, Course Number, Discussion Number, User Number) and enter it into different worksheets in a Google spreadsheet.

The data from Canvas API is returned in the JSON data format.  This script converts the data into a flat spreadsheet.

This is a work is progress with immediate need dictating the direction and amount of time being put into this project.
